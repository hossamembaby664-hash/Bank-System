# Bank-System
This project is a Banking System implemented in Java, designed to simulate real-world banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money, and managing client data. It focuses on file handling, error management, and performance optimization, making it a simple example of how banking applications work

I applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as (polymorphism and encapsulation) in this project.  
You are welcome to take a look at the code and share your feedback!
